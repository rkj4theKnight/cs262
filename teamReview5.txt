Homework 5 (Review of Team A)

1a. Based on what I saw on GitHub, my stakeholder team (Team A) definitely show an appropriate amount of activity throught the semester. There seemed to be commits on
    basically every day over the past month or so, which goes to show that they were continuously fixing bugs and making updates. This is also consistent with what I
    saw in the past.
1b. I thought their final presentation was alright. Personally, compared to their first presentation, the final presentation didn't seem much more impressive. That is,
    apart from the fact that they can login to the same account in multiple different devices. Other than that, there wasn't much different.
1c. Overall, it is evident that the main functions of their app work properly, even the ability to login to multiple devices with the same data. I like the simplicity of
    the app in general, especially the ablity to easily manually add or remove projects and times. I appreciated that they trusted the opinions and suggestions due to the
    user testing, and the improvements were evident. I also really liked the ability to login to multiple devices; truth be told, I don't necessarily think it was necessary,
    but it's a cool feature nonetheless. However, I think that the design was a bit too bland. While the entire app used a consistent design, the design itself was a bit too
    bland. It looked like it used the default Android Studio fonts, menu structures, and color schemes. I understand that they wanted to create an app that didn't have too
    many distractions, but I still think you can redesign an app to make it look much better without distracting the user.
