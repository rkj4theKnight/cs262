Team A review

2a. It seems alright. There are quiete a few Trello cards that indicate activity from some people, but their "faces" haven't been added to the card, so there's no way to see at
a glance who's actually working on what.

2b. The SQL schema model is seemed pretty simple. The employee can have many projects, and each project can have many times, so the employee is capable of having multiple timers at once.
What I'm uncertain of is if all of these times are being stored; and, if so, if/how/when they would be deleted. I would also like to know if the saved times are automatically saved with 
a certain file format, to make it easier to distinguish when people worked on projects, when they did it, and for how long.

2c. There has been quite a few commits (over 100 now), which makes me think that they push small changes very frequently. The app runs, and their database sort of works, but they aren't wired together yet.

2d. The presentation was alright. The overall design of the app was simple but good. But the multiple timer features all seemed to work well, which is good.
I still think that they should see if they can get the timers to continue, even if the app closes. That's one nice feature of OS default clock apps.
Their presentation seemed well rehearsed overall. I'd rank it in the top half of the class.
