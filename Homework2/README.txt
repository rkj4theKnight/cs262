To whoever is grading Homework 2...

My apologies for turning this in on the the 22nd (Monday), as it was due on the 19th (Friday). I am using one of my grace days for this homework assignment.

Please note that my code does not function properly. Originally I was able to display everything in the JSON file, but not in the proper format.
After adding code that should have separated the parts of the JSON file properly, it no longer showed any results, and I have no idea why.
After all that was said and done, I realized that I had selected an Empty Template rather than a Basic Template, so therefore I forgot to add a Settings option.

Long story short, I spent several hours trying to figure out how to get this app to function correctly; alas, with very little to show for it. But at least I tried :/
