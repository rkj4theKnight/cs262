Homework 4 (Review of Team A)

2a. Team A's user test was very well laid out. There was a piece of paper with a list of instructions to do, demonstrating the different capabilities of the app.
    For the most part, I knew exactly what to do based on the instructions listed on the piece of paper. The app included a menu with clearly-labeled pages, and 
    each of the pages did exactly what I expected. Other than a couple of glitches and mediocre design choices, the app was simple but effective.
2b. It looks like there's been enough code, although nobody has pushed to the master branch for about a week. My guess is that they didn't want to make changes
    until the usability tests had been completed.
