## CS 262 - Software Engineering Code

This set of quick-start applications is distributed for use by students
of [CS 262 at Calvin College](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262).
The applications include:

- examples of Android Applications implemented using Java in Android Studio.
- an example of a REST interface to a PostgreSQL database implemented
using the Google Cloud Platform in Intellij IDEA.

For details, see the
[course schedule](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/schedule.html).

### Getting Started

To use this code, do the following:
1. Create your own CS 262 code repo on GitHub:
```https://github.com/GITHUB_ID/cs262```
2. Clone this quick-start repo to your local machine.
3. Add a second git remote to this new local copy pointing to your new
CS 262 repo and then commit/push this code to your new GitHub CS 262
repo. For details on this process, see
[Git Basics - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).

You will generally work with this initial copy in your own repo.
If we make changes to this quick-start code, we will let you know what's
changed so that you can pull/merge those changes into your own code.
