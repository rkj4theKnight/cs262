9.1.a: There are five unique API end points in work.sh
9.1.b.i: JDBC
9.1.b.ii.1: SQL statements reference a relation within a database, while the JDBC statements only know about the end points and the player objects.
9.1.b.ii.2: SQL relations contain the relationships of the tables and properties of the tables in your database. the JDBC result sets contain the JSON results of the queries from the database. List<player> contains the properties of the player
9.1.b.iii.: getValueStringOrNull() is used anytime queried relation contains null or string values.
9.1.c.i: The Player DAO contains a player object and methods to update and return player properties
9.1.c.ii.: This is very similar to the Player table that we created in the SQL schema, yet there are some differences. Both define a player and the properties that make one: id, email, and name. the Java implementation is the code version, and the SQL implementation is the database version whhich defines what information the player table will hold. In the SQL table, there will be a player per row.
